#Trikora.py: A JythonMusic project that basically works as a MIDI VST. 
# William Blanchett. Last Updated October 21, 2016
# Basic Program Process:
#         Create a MIDI Device. Obtain input from MIDI device. Split input into
#				three different channels. Make each channel have its own MIDI
#               voice. Allow each voice to have independent volume, tuning
#               (possibly panning). 
#               
# Stretch Goals: Graphic Display, Autopilot mode (Recursive Generator)
